        <li>Callback hell or Pyramid of doom</li>
        <p>
          When a function is passed as an argument to another function, it
          becomes a callback function. This process continues and there are many
          callbacks inside another's Callback function. This grows the code
          horizontally instead of vertically. That mechanism is known as
          callback hell.
        </p>

        <li>Inversion of control</li>
        <p>
          The callback function is passed to another callback, this way we lose
          the control of our code. We don't know what is happening behind the
          scene and the program becomes very difficult to maintain. That process
          is called inversion of control.
